Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = __webpack_require__(61);\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = __webpack_require__(80);\nutil.inherits = __webpack_require__(66);\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

Sometimes it's called a \"filter\",\n// but that's not a great name for it, since that implies a thing where\n// some bits pass through, and others are simply ignored.  (That would\n// be a valid example of a transform, of course.)\n//\n// While the output is causally related to the input, it's not a\n// necessarily symmetric or synchronous transformation.  For example,\n// a zlib stream might take multiple plain-text writes(), and then\n// emit a single compressed chunk some time in the future.\n//\n// Here's how this works:\n//\n// The Transform stream has all the aspects of the readable and writable\n// stream classes.  When you write(chunk), that calls _write(chunk,cb)\n// internally, and returns false if there's a lot of pending writes\n// buffered up.  When you call read(), that calls _read(n) until\n// there's enough pending readable data buffered up.\n//\n// In a transform stream, the written data is placed in a buffer.  When\n// _read(n) is called, it transforms the queued up data, calling the\n// buffered _write cb's as it consumes chunks.  If consuming a single\n// written chunk would result in multiple output chunks, then the first\n// outputted bit calls the readcb, and subsequent chunks just go into\n// the read buffer, and will cause it to emit 'readable' if necessary.\n//\n// This way, back-pressure is actually determined by the reading side,\n// since _read has to be called to start processing a new chunk.  However,\n// a pathological inflate type of transform can cause excessive buffering\n// here.  For example, imagine a stream where every byte of input is\n// interpreted as an integer from 0-255, and then results in that many\n// bytes of output.  Writing the 4 bytes {ff,ff,ff,ff} would result in\n// 1kb of data being output.  In this case, you could write a very small\n// amount of input, and end up with a very large amount of output.  In\n// such a pathological inflating mechanism, there'd be no way to tell\n// the system to stop doing the transform.  A single 4MB write could\n// cause the system to run out of memory.\n//\n// However, even in such a pathological case, only a single written chunk\n// would be consumed, and then the rest would wait (un-transformed) until\n// the results of the previous transformed chunk were consumed.\n\n'use strict';\n\nmodule.exports = Transform;\n\nvar Duplex = require('./_stream_duplex');\n\n/*<replacement>*/\nvar util = require('core-util-is');\nutil.inherits = require('inherits');\n/*</replacement>*/\n\nutil.inherits(Transform, Duplex);\n\nfunction TransformState(stream) {\n  this.afterTransform = function (er, data) {\n    return afterTransform(stream, er, data);\n  };\n\n  this.needTransform = false;\n  this.transforming = false;\n  this.writecb = null;\n  this.writechunk = null;\n  this.writeencoding = null;\n}\n\nfunction afterTransform(stream, er, data) {\n  var ts = stream._transformState;\n  ts.transforming = false;\n\n  var cb = ts.writecb;\n\n  if (!cb) return stream.emit('error', new Error('no writecb in Transform class'));\n\n  ts.writechunk = null;\n  ts.writecb = null;\n\n  if (data !== null && data !== undefined) stream.push(data);\n\n  cb(er);\n\n  var rs = stream._readableState;\n  rs.reading = false;\n  if (rs.needReadable || rs.length < rs.highWaterMark) {\n    stream._read(rs.highWaterMark);\n  }\n}\n\nfunction Transform(options) {\n  if (!(this instanceof Transform)) return new Transform(options);\n\n  Duplex.call(this, options);\n\n  this._transformState = new TransformState(this);\n\n  var stream = this;\n\n  // start out asking for a readable event once data is transformed.\n  this._readableState.needReadable = true;\n\n  // we have implemented the _read method, and done the other things\n  // that Readable wants before the first _read call, so unset the\n  // sync guard flag.\n  this._readableState.sync = false;\n\n  if (options) {\n    if (typeof options.transform === 'function') this._transform = options.transform;\n\n    if (typeof options.flush === 'function') this._flush = options.flush;\n  }\n\n  // When the writable side finishes, then flush out anything remaining.\n  this.once('prefinish', function () {\n    if (typeof this._flush === 'function') this._flush(function (er, data) {\n      done(stream, er, data);\n    });else done(stream);\n  });\n}\n\nTransform.prototype.push = function (chunk, encoding) {\n  this._transformState.needTransform = false;\n  return Duplex.prototype.push.call(this, chunk, encoding);\n};\n\n// This is the part where you do stuff!\n// override this function in implementation classes.\n// 'chunk' is an input chunk.\n//\n// Call `push(newChunk)` to pass along transformed output\n// to the readable side.

It was quite amazing that UC extended their deadline of application this year, leaving me three weeks right after my final exams to finish the application with Year Education’s assistance.`\n},{\n    name: 'Brayden',\n    college: 'DVC',\n    acceptBy: ' USC (Marshall), UIUC, Michigan Ann Arbor (Ross), Indiana (Bloomington), UNC(Kenan-Flagler)',\n    university: 'UC Berkeley',\n    major: 'Haas Business',\n    service: '两年制孵化器',\n    photo: 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/yeah-assets/medias/photos/temp-profile/Brayden.jpg',\n    content: `在与Kevin一起构造Personal Statement的过程中，虽然我反复地修改了四十余次，这个过程也非常痛苦，但是这也是我对我自己这两年的成长的一个反思。在这两年时间里，Kevin塑造了一个本来很自卑的男孩到一个自信的Business man的成长过程。这完完全全地反应了我这两年的内心变化。 这篇PS对我来说，不仅是一篇简简单单的Essay，而更多的是见证了我这两年的飞跃。\n       半年之后，我成功地拿到了哈斯商学院的offer，成为哈斯全球招生90人中的其中一员。YEAH对于我来说不仅帮助了我完成转学、踏入哈斯的殿堂的梦想，还改变了我的人生。`\n},{\n    name: 'Michelle Hu',\n    college: 'DVC',\n    acceptBy: 'UCB, UCSD, UCD, UCI, UCSB',\n    university: 'UC Berkeley',\n    major: 'Political Economics',\n    service: '短期冲刺保录取项目',\n    photo: 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/yeah-assets/medias/photos/temp-profile/Michelle.jpg',\n    content: `虽然欧耶还比较年轻，但当我逐步地了解和熟悉里面的顾问和导师，我相信他们有足够的能力来帮我完成申请。直至最后，我敢肯定的是，如果当初我没有选择欧耶，我会扛不住压力，完不成申请。最后一个月冲刺写申请的时候，我也会熬夜到凌晨，每天只睡3个小时。但欧耶的导师Adriane坚持与我一起熬夜讨论和修改ps，一千字的文章在一个月里被改了不下20遍。申请的经历远没有想象中的简单，但有了欧耶的陪伴和鼓励，我坚持到了最后。`\n},{\n    name: 'Sunny Lee',\n    college: 'DVC',\n    acceptBy: 'UCB, UCLA, UCSD, UCD, UCI, UCSB',\n    university: 'UC Berkeley',\n    major: 'Economics',\n    service: '短期冲刺保录取项目',\n    photo: 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/yeah-assets/medias/photos/temp-profile/Sunny.jpg',\n    content: `遇到了热心的学长介绍，我才知道了欧耶教育。导师Shutian给了我很大的帮助，她不仅帮我找到了自己身上可以写用来写文书的闪光点，还用过来人的经验告诉我应该突出哪些特长。她真的把我的申请当成她自己的一样，每次修改好后还专门拿去问她的同事和朋友们有什么建议。很感谢她这样帮我，我相信最初选择YEAH是正确的。`\n},{\n    name: 'Peter Zhou',\n    college: 'DVC',\n    acceptBy: 'UCB, UCSD, UCD, UCI, UCSB',\n    university: 'UC Berkeley',\n    major: 'Statistics + Environmental Economics',\n    service: '短期冲刺保录取项目',\n    photo: 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/yeah-assets/medias/photos/temp-profile/Peter.jpg',\n    content: `虽然导师的母语是英语，但她也能很流利地讲中文。所以每一次我用英文表达不出来的时候，她都会用中文引导我，然后再用她纯熟的英文写作功底来帮我架构我的个人陈述。通过一次次与导师梳理思路、修改讨论，我的个人陈述和简历里的每一个词都经过了推敲，每一句描述都用的刚刚好。我觉得自己很幸运地能在这个阶段接受到专业的帮助，完成了高质量的文书。对我而言完成申请的过程也是一个重新发现自己、定位自己的过程。希望未来还能和YEAH有再合作的机会。`\n},{\n    name: 'Zoe Ying',\n    college: 'DVC',\n    acceptBy: 'UCB, UCSD, UCD, UCI, UCSB',\n    university: 'UC Berkeley',\n    major: 'Environmental Economics',\n    service: '短期冲刺保录取项目',\n    photo: 'https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/yeah-assets/medias/photos/temp-profile/Zoe.jpg',\n    content: `我很喜欢我的导师，一个双商都超高的韩国欧巴Brian。他帮我罗列出了我人生的每一个亮点，然后细心筛选，把能想到的细节都写出来，再多花时间帮我一句句修改。最重要的是他让我知道我是一个有故事的人，而且能找到一个独特的角度来升华我的故事。说实话，在遇到Brian之前，我真的觉得自己是一个没有故事的人。虽然有时觉得要抓狂，但那段神经高度紧绷的申请时光还是蛮过瘾的。在YEAH的帮助下我不仅完成了这次转学申请的挑战，也得到了很大的提升，“一分耕耘一分收获”，希望未来自己不被亏待。`\n}]\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./client/src/components/home/stories/data.js","import React, {Component} from 'react';\nimport commentData from './data';\n\nexport default class SProgram extends Component {\n    componentWillMount(){\n        // console.log('commentData: ', commentData)\n    }\n    renderCard(){\n        return commentData.map(student=>{\n            return (\n                <div className=\"card comment\" key={student.name}>\n                <div className=\"university\">{student.university}</div>\n                <div className=\"body\">\n                    <div className=\"photo\" style={{backgroundImage: `url(${student.photo})` }}></div>\n                    <div className=\"name\">{student.name}</div>\n                    <div className=\"major\">{student.major}&nbsp;Major</div>\n                    <hr />\n                    <div className=\"content\">...{student.content}...</div>\n                    <hr/>\n                    <div className=\"service\">2 Year Program (2015-2016)</div>\n                    <div className=\"acceptBy\">Got other admissions: &nbsp;{student.acceptBy}</div>\n                </div>\n                </div>\n            )\n        })\n    }\n  render() {\n    return (\n      <div className=\"section comment\" style={{background: \"#f4f4ef\"}}>\n      <div className=\"title\">Successful Stories</div>\n        <div className=\"h-scrollable no-border\">\n            {this.renderCard()}\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    );\n  }\n}\n\n\n// WEBPACK FOOTER //\n// ./client/src/components/home/stories/index.js","const Introduction = `欧耶教育（Yeah Education Group）致力于帮助社区学院的学子实现转学和求职之梦。 我们专注于 学业指导、实习对接、转学申请、职场培训 无论是短期申请季冲刺，还是长期全方位打造，我们都有你最需要的。 我们是从社区学院成功转入美国顶尖大学的学长学姐； 我们有来自Columbia、Cornell、UC Berkeley等世界名校的资深导师； 我们有活跃在Morgan Stanley、KPMG、PwC等公司的职场精英。 自2014年于UC Berkeley成立以来， 我们以强大的团队阵容、丰富的申请经验、精准的一手资讯为300+学子的梦想保驾护航。\n\\n\\n Our goal is to help every student succeed in the Community College life!
